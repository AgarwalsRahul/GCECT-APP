# GCECT-APP
An native android application of Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology

## Problem Statement:

Our university website was not properly optimised and responsive for mobile devices which posed difficulties for students to navigate and to utilise all the features the website has to offer. Also some times students are missing important notices as they don't get any notification. Also to view a simple notice all students need to download the notice from the website. Our university website Ui also not so user friendly and informative for new comers also there has not any discussion or helping. Altogather we can achieve a lot of functionality using an user friendly mobile application. Therefore we, team GDSC-GCECT come with an idea of an user friendly android app named "GCECT APP".


## Proposed Solution:

This project proposes an university app which has all the features of the university website with some extra added features and a good user interface. As in each page of our website all the informations are messy and not cleared therefore our first target is a good user interface which make every details attractive to all.As we mentioned that for a less important notice we need to download  the pdfs therefore we made a pdf viewer section in our app where users can read the notice without download it.We also add a funcionality to download the notice if required. Also through an app students can get the update of important notices and also there should be a discussion forum in the app where students can discuss about their doubts and teachers can share their notes and assignments directly through the app to all of students. Students also can take  short notes which can be saved offline. Also in our different college fests there we need different websites which are not maintained later on. So we can integrate all the necessary things regarding fests directly to the app therefore there will not be required a separate website for separate fest or event.Not only that, many many more functionlity could be added to the app which will make the app more useful to both students and teachers but this will not possible in a website.But in this short time, we are not able to add all the features to the app. Actually it a on going project and we are trying to make it our college's official app.

Some features that are included in the app are:
<ul>
  <li>A good UI/UX to make every page more attractive and informative</li>
  <li>recent announcements</li>
  <li>general notice</li>
  <li>download examination schedule</li>
  <li>a note taking section</li>
</ul>
